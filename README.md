U.S. Economic Indicators for CPI Prediction
Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a dataset aimed at predicting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) using key U.S. economic indicators. The dataset integrates various economic factors, allowing for an analysis of their relationships and impacts on inflation trends.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:

UNRATE: The unemployment rate in the U.S., reflecting the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking employment.

Interest Rate: The nominal interest rate set by the Federal Reserve, influencing borrowing costs and consumer spending.

GDP_PCH: The percentage change in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), indicating the growth rate of the economy.

CPI_PCH: The percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), representing the rate of inflation.

10-Year Treasury Yield: The yield on U.S. Treasury bonds with a maturity of ten years, which serves as a benchmark for other interest rates.

Time: The time period in years, providing a temporal context for the economic indicators.

Objective
The primary objective of this dataset is to analyze how these economic indicators interact with and influence the CPI over time. This analysis can help in understanding inflation dynamics and support better economic forecasting.

Methodology
Data Collection: The dataset was compiled from reputable sources, including the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve, and World Bank.

Data Filtering: The data was filtered to focus on yearly changes in economic indicators, allowing for a clearer analysis of trends.

CPI Prediction: Statistical models, such as linear regression and machine learning algorithms, can be employed to predict future CPI values based on the selected economic indicators.

How to Use This Dataset
This dataset can be utilized for various analyses, including:

Economic forecasting and modeling.
Studying the relationships between different economic indicators and CPI.
Developing machine learning models for predictive analytics.
